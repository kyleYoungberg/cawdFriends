A conceputal social media site to practice with form elements 

Goals I accomplished:
Make a decent looking website and use javascript to make a sign-up page for a conceptual social media site with form text inputs and a button that functioned to remove any text from the inputs

Things I would change:
Make it actually work and use PHP to store the data on a server
Remove the underlines on the NAV, these tend to not look very professional
Improve alignment so the page title aligns with the left side of the NAV or visa versa and do the same with the subheader for the sign-up form
shrink the buttons, as buttons that large don't look very professional or conventional
